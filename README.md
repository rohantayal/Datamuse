# making-a-get-request

In this exercise, we’re going to use a GET request using fetch() and .then() to access the Datamuse API and render the fetched information in the browser.

The Datamuse API is a word-finding query engine for developers. It can be used in apps to find words that match a given set of constraints that are likely in a given context.

If the request is successful, we’ll get back an array of words that sound like the word we typed into the input field.
